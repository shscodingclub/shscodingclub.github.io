                <h2>Congress Poised To Eliminate Key Tax Breaks For Middle Class, Provide Permanent Tax Breaks For Corporations</h2>
                <p class="info">November 29, 2014 / From <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/11/25/3596971/congress-to-end-tax-breaks-for-middle-class-provide-permanent-relief-to-large-corporations/">ThinkProgress (Internet Blog)</a></p>
                <p>This article is about 440 words long and has 10 paragraphs, including the "updates." It doesn't give the reader any relevant background information on the issue. Most importantly, it doesn't say why the package of tax breaks was proposed in the first place. The author's approach to the discussion suggests that he is playing the role of a public advocate who is more concerned about the interests of the people.</p>
                <p>The article is biased against the package of tax breaks. It mentions a single positive outcome of implementing the package but then begins to criticize it. The author says that it is only "intended to help businesses" at the cost of well-being of working Americans. It has four quotations from three sources and all of them talk about the negative impact of the deal, which means that they are not representative of all sides of the issue. Also, the "updates" in the end of the article strongly emphasize that the President "would veto [the package] anyway." Since the deal is portrayed in such negative light, that emphasis improves the reader's opinion about the Democrats. Therefore, I can conclude that the author is biased towards the Democratic party and against the package.</p>

                <h2>Many caught in a rental crunch, homeless families vying for 73 new rental vouchers</h2>
                <p class="info">November 29, 2014 / From The Boston Globe, Vol. 286, No. 151, P. A1, A17 (Newspaper)</p>
                <p>This article is trying to give an objective report on the situation with housing for the poor people in Mass. The article consists of 21 long paragraphs and each paragraph has 45 words on average. This is similar to the size of the article I read previously in The Boston Globe. It tells the reader a lot of background information on the issue. In addition to the background information, it also discusses at length the causes of the problems with housing.</p>
                <p>About half of the article presents quotations from various sources. The article quotes two officials, mentions a professor at the UMass Boston as a source, and describes stories of four individuals who are in desperate need for better living conditions. Since the article does not present any personal opinion but merely tells the facts about an issue that is inherently important, I do not think it can be considered biased.</p>

                <h2>Future Of Undocumented Immigrants In Mass.</h2>
                <p class="info">November 28, 2014 / From <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cB5w9qUC84">WGBH News (Radio News)</a>
                <p>This discussion attempts to explore the possible change of immigration policies in Mass. under a new governor. It is about 10 minutes long and includes enough background information about the Baker's actions and rhetoric on immigration. The discussion references five sources: two hosts, a democratic senator, a republican senator, and the expert on Latino issues.</p>
                <p>Hosts describe the Baker's shift to a more liberal attitude towards immigration as “evolution” and explain why the change cannot be avoided anymore, which suggests that they are biased. The expert is biased as well since he also supports the change in Baker's attitude. Since the two senators come from different parties, they do not affect the balance of the discussion. Therefore, I believe the discussion is biased towards the supporters of immigration policy changes.</p>

                <h2>Obama to Introduce Sweeping New Controls on Ozone Emissions</h2>
                <p class="info">November 26, 2014 / From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/us/politics/obama-to-introduce-sweeping-new-controls-on-ozone-emissions.html">New York Times (Newspaper)</a></p>
                <p>This article is an objective report on the President's plan to strengthen the Ozone pollution regulations. The article is about 840 words long and contains 16 paragraphs. It gives the reader enough background information on the issue and provides a thorough explanation of the change. I believe this explanation could be shortened without affecting the quality of the article because it tells the reader technical details that do not really contribute to the discussion.</p>
                <p>However, the article seems not to be biased towards any particular group. It presents both arguments for the change and arguments against it. Its use of quotations and other sources also appears to be unbiased. I found it interesting that this particular article gave the exact same number of sources and dedicated approximately the same amount of text to both sides of the issue.</p>

                <h2>The role of the media in the society as described by "Wag the Dog"</h2>
                <p class="info">November 26, 2014</p>
                <p>The public influences the mass media by demanding a specific kind of content from it. The movie showed how the public's interest in scandals and wars shaped the news that the media was striving to spread. At the same time, the media influences the public opinion on issues by choosing events to cover and how to do this. In the movie, this was demonstrated by the spin doctor's lack of concern about whether the accusation was true &mdash; the media would turn it into news and would describe it in a way that destroys the President's reputation regardless of its truth.</p>
                <p>The President was so concerned about this accusation, in part, because the public elects government officials and his own election was coming up. Since the public opinion is affected by the mass media, his public relations office could not resolve the crisis without using the media's capacity to change the public opinion. In the movie, the spin doctor created a war that only existed in the media in order to gain support for the President and to distract people from the accusation.</p>

                <h2>The Ferguson verdict: No indictment</h2>
                <p class="info">November 25, 2014 / From <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/11/ferguson-verdict">The Economist Democarcy in America Blog (Internet Blog)</a></p>
                <p>This article from a blog hosted at the website of The Economist magazine is the shortest one I have encountered so far &mdash; 430 words and 5 paragraphs long. It is intended to provide an objective report on the grand jury decision on the Ferguson conflict. Although the background information in this article is represented only by a couple of sentences, it is sufficient to remind the reader about the conflict. It includes quotations of M. Brown's parents and the President. These quotations, however, are not representative of all sides of the issue. Neither of the used sources participated in a similar protest before, and therefore they both are likely to have the same perspective on the problem.</p>
                <p>However, the article as a whole appears to be unbiased, despite its quotations being not representative. While a part of the article is dedicated to a description of how protestors' gatherings "turned violent" and the destruction of property that they caused, another part of equivalent size tells the reader about other unnecessary shootings, implying that the protestors have a reason to be angry. Moreover, one of the above-mentioned sources suggests isolating violent protestors from "the vast majority of [those] who want to protest peacefully," showing that not all protestors are as violent as they might appear to the public.</p>

                <h2>GOP says Obama pushes popular immigration policies to win votes. Er, that's called democracy.</h2>
                <p class="info">November 24, 2014 / From <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/11/23/1346270/-GOP-says-Obama-pushes-popular-immigration-policies-to-win-votes-Er-that-s-called-democracy">Daily Kos (Internet Blog)</a></p>
                <p>This article criticizes the position of Republicans on the immigration reform. Rather than giving background information on the issue; it refers the reader to other articles that provide this information. Unlike the majority of articles in newspapers or online news sources, this article doesn't attempt to directly convince the reader that a specific side of the argument is right. Instead, it tries to poke fun at the author's opponents, dismissing their arguments as ridiculous, thus making the other side appear right.</p>
                <p>The article mentions a lot of Republicans and quotes three of them, including Ronald Reagan, in a manner that emphasizes the rightness of Democrats. This allows the article not to include any quotations of its supporters. It consists of about twelve long paragraphs and a thousand words in total. Most of this volume is filled with examples of Republicans' hypocrisy and vivid commentary on their quotations &mdash; "what they call pandering," "absurd notion," and "making noises." Meanwhile, Democrats are portrayed as the party with clearly defined goals, which cannot be said about Republicans according to the article, who support a "comprehensive immigration reform." It is obviously biased against Republicans.</p>

                <h2>President Obama Offers Legal Status to Millions of Undocumented Immigrants</h2>
                <p class="info">November 21, 2014 / From <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-offer-legal-status-millions-undocumented-immigrants/story?id=27063573">ABC News (Internet News with Video)</a></p>
                <p>In my opinion, this is a well-written article when compared to stories in other news outlets. The article includes six sources, including the president, that cover both sides of the debate. All sources, except the Department of Homeland Security, are quoted at least once. Three sources are supportive of the president's plan and three other sources, including senators from an independent party and the Democratic party, question the president's decision to act on his own. There is enough background information about the new policy and a large portion of this information comes directly from the president. The story is 1150 words long, which is longer than an average Internet article. I believe the article is not biased towards any particular side of the argument and is successful at objectively reporting the story.</p>
                <p>An accompanying video, however, "Obama Going It Alone on Immigration," seems to be biased against the new policy. Its predictions about the new plan are quite pessimistic. The arguments of the commentator suggest that the change will be very complicated but not very beneficial due to the fact that it doesn't protect illegal immigrants in case the policy is taken down. The video includes three speakers &mdash; a Republican senator, the host, and the commentator, and they do not present any other opinion. Even the title of the video suggests that the president has no supporters in the government.</p>

                <h2>Immigrants face major hurdles in signing up to new Obama plan</h2>
                <p class="info">November 20, 2014 / From <a href="http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/immigrants-face-major-hurdles-in-signing-up-to-new-obama-plan/ar-BBeN7hX">MSN News (Internet News)</a></p>
                <p>Although the article would benefit from a better description of the new policy, it gives the reader enough background information to determine the significance of the change. The story uses five sources but they are not representative of both sides of the argument. All five of them emphasize or suggest problems with the new policy and there are no speakers who support the new plan.</p>
                <p>The article seems to be biased against the president's plan to relax the immigration policy. It never mentions the beneficial aspects of the new plan. In addition to that, most of the content in the article points out flaws or potential problems with the new Obama plan. The article doesn't succeed at its attempt to be impartial because its description of ways of mitigating these problems is very brief and creates an impression that they are not sufficient.</p>
                <p>It seems that both articles I encountered while reading Internet news outlets are suffering from the same problems. All of them are about 600 words long, which doesn't permit them to cover a given problem in enough detail and present all sides of the argument. They also have difficulties giving the reader the right amount of background information, presumably due to the fact that they have to address a much wider audience than a local newspaper or a news program.</p>

                <p class="info">November 19, 2014 / From The Boston Globe, Vol. 286, No. 141, P. A4 (Newspaper)</p>
                <p>This newspaper article informs the reader about the confirmation of John Hoover as the U.S. ambassador to Sierra Leone and the current state of Ebola outbreak in that country. It gives the reader a sufficient amount of background information on this person and does not go into too many details about the outbreak itself. The length of the article, 20 paragraphs with about 40 words per paragraph, is adequate for conveying its message. The article uses five sources: the longest quotations belong to J. Hoover and they comment on hardships of working in Sierra Leone. The words of other speakers are being used, in a paraphrased form, to describe the difficulties of controlling the outbreak.</p>
                <p>The article strives to provide an objective report on the event with opinions that cannot be questioned, such as the need to "sharpen coordination" in Sierra Leone. Since the article does not make an argument possible, quotations should not be considered unrepresentative and the article cannot be biased towards a specific side.</p>

                <h2>Missouri governor activates National Guard</h2>
                <p class="info">November 18, 2014 / From <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/missouri-governor-activates-national-guard-201522300.html">Yahoo News (Internet News)</a></p>
                <p>This article is not very informative and definitely is not a thorough source. It is very short (612 words) and includes too much background information. Specifically, it devotes two long paragraphs, or almost a third of its content, to describing the very basic facts about the conflict that should not be a revelation to anyone given the resonance of the shooting. The article mentions four parties, but only quotes two of them. The quotations of the Missouri governor are used to explain the reasoning behind his decision, while the words of St.Louis Mayor are addressing the fears of those who are affected by that decision &mdash; i.e. both quoted sources have the same opinion on the decision. The other two sources were only used once, to give the reader a general time frame in which the change will be effective.</p>
                <p>Although the quotations were not representative of all sides of the issue, I don't think the article is biased because its intent was not to change the reader's opinion but to merely inform him about the course of action taken by the government officials in response to a crisis. The short format of the article &mdash; and the apparent requirement to thoroughly describe the conflict's history &mdash; doesn't allow it to sufficiently cover even a single opinion, not to mention multiple sides of the argument.</p>
